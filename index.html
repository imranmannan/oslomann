            <p><strong>I have felt</strong> the unbearable lightness of my dynamic identity. It is surreal to be from somewhere as transient as a capital city. As a child of immigrants, I often felt rejected by imaginary (and for some, all-too-real) opps in the city of my birth. A born-and-bred Londoner, I mouth off about TikTok yuppies who've never even heard of my suburb coming in and telling me about community and coffee shops and jazz bars. I walk past 10,000 tourists a day, try to refrain from Americanisms, took The Knowledge in meal deals and tube station exits. And I'm sure I displaced families and jacked up rent prices too when I moved around the city. Shame externalised as judgement. I am both the original and the new.</p>
            <p>That was then. Now I live in Oslo. I love it here. And I wonder who I am now - turist, innvandrer, eventually a local? Migrating has helped me understand: you must live and let live. Heal from the guilt. Accept the entropy. Make peace with change. Make peace with yourself. </p>
